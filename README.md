# Predictive-Model-Classification
This notebook analyzes customer churn data using Python. It works with two CSV datasets, checks for missing values, and preprocesses the data by encoding categorical variables. The workflow uses libraries like pandas and scikit-learn for data handling, label encoding, and feature scaling to prepare the data for machine learning tasks.
