ðŸ“Š Outcome & Business Impact: 

ðŸŽ¯ End Result: 

The project developed a machine learning model (Tuned Random Forest) that predicts customer churn with 95% accuracy, 91% precision, and 73% recall. 
Among the models tested, the tuned Random Forest achieved the best overall performance, particularly in identifying customers likely to churn, while minimizing false alarms.


ðŸ’¡Business Value:

    Proactive Retention: The model helps the business identify customers at risk of leaving before they actually churn. With this insight, the company can target these customers 
    with retention campaigns, personalized offers, or improved serviceâ€”reducing customer loss and increasing revenue stability.

    Resource Optimization: By focusing retention efforts on the most likely churners (thanks to high precision), the business saves time and money compared to blanket strategies.

    Customer Insights: Analysis of the model can reveal which features (e.g., customer service calls, international plan) are most influential, guiding improvements in service, 
    pricing, or communication.

    Data-Driven Decisions: Leadership can use churn predictions for forecasting, strategic planning, and measuring the impact of interventions over time.

In a nutshell:
Implementing this churn prediction model allows the business to be more proactive, efficient, and customer-focusedâ€”turning raw data into meaningful action that drives both 
customer satisfaction and profitability.
